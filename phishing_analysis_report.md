## ðŸš¨ Phishing Indicators

1. **Spoofed Email Address**: `amaz0n-billing.com` tries to mimic `amazon.com`.

3. **Urgency/Threatening Language**: "Failure to act..." â€“ a scare tactic.
4. **Generic Salutation**: "Dear Customer" instead of real name.
5. **Spelling/Grammar**: Slightly off phrasing and missing typical footer.
